# forsuredbcompiler
forsuredbcompiler is Annotation processor for the forsuredb project that handles code and resource generation.
As the central part of the forsuredb project, it is one of libraries necessary for forsuredb to work.

## Quickstart

### The four library dependencies for your application
1. forsuredbcompiler (compile only)
2. forsuredbapi
3. A platform integration library (see https://github.com/ryansgot/forsuredbandroid for an example)
4. An SQL library conforming to the forsuredb standards (see https://github.com/ryansgot/forsuredbsqlitelib for an example). Libraries 3 and 4 can be combined, however.

### Using forsuredb in Android
- Create a new Android project (see https://github.com/ryansgot/forsuredbandroid for a sample app)
- Set up the project build.gradle repositories and dependencies like this:
```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()   // <-- all jar/aar files for forsuredb are hosted on jcenter
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.3'
        classpath 'com.fsryan:forsuredbplugin:0.4.0'    // <-- if using forsuredbapi 0.8.1 and below, use forsuredbplugin 0.3.1
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter() // <-- all jar/aar files for forsuredb are hosted on jcenter
        maven {     // <-- except for forsuredbcompiler 7.0 and up . . . which are currently hosted here
            url  "http://dl.bintray.com/ryansgot/maven"
        }
    }
}
```
- Amend your app build.gradle file as such:
```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'com.fsryan.forsuredb'    // <-- provides the dbmigrate task

/*...*/

dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.guava:guava:19.0'

    compile 'com.fsryan.forsuredb:forsuredbapi:0.11.0'          // common API for your code and the supporting libraries
    compile 'com.fsryan.forsuredb:sqlitelib:0.5.0'              // the SQLite DBMS integration
    compile 'com.fsryan.forsuredb:forsuredbandroid:0.11.0@aar'  // the Android integration and useful tools

    provided 'com.fsryan.forsuredb:forsuredbcompiler:0.11.0'    // these classes are not needed at runtime--they do code generation
    annotationProcessor 'com.fsryan.forsuredb:forsuredbcompiler:0.11.0'         // runs the forsuredb annotation processor at compile time
}

forsuredb {
    // should be the same as the applicationId from the android extension
    applicationPackageName = 'com.fsryan.testapp'
    // the fully-qualified class name of the parameterization of the SaveResult.
    // If you have an Android project, this should be the result parameter.
    resultParameter = "android.net.Uri"
    // The fully-qualified class name of the parameterization of the generated
    // ForSure class. It is the class that stores a record before it is 
    // deleted/inserted/updated etc.
    recordContainer = "com.fsryan.forsuredb.provider.FSContentValues"
    // the assets directory of your app starting at your project's base directory
    migrationDirectory = 'app/src/main/assets'
    // Your application module's base directory
    appProjectDirectory = 'app'
    // (optional) this is the directory in which your META-INF/services files will go for your custom plugins. Note that this is not the same directory as your Android resources (res)
    resourcesDirectory = 'app/src/main/resources'
    // (optional) fully-qualified class name of an implementation of FSSerializerFactory. You must define both resourcesDirectory and fsSerializerFactoryClass in order for your doc store to perorm custom serialization
    fsSerializerFactoryClass = 'com.my.application.json.AdapterFactory'
    // (required) This is the glue that ties in your chosen DBMS. forsuresqlitelib 0.4.0 contains a version for SQLite,
    // however, for Android projects, this must be used in conjunction with forsuredbandroid 0.9.+ because there are
    // additional Android platform considerations here to allow for smooth integration with android.database.sqlite
    dbmsIntegratorClass = 'com.fsryan.forsuredb.FSAndroidSQLiteGenerator'
}
```
- Declare an application class and the ```FSDefaultProvider``` in your app's AndroidManifest.xml file:
```xml
<application
        android:name=".App" >
  <!-- ... -->
  <provider
      android:name="com.fsryan.forsuredb.provider.FSDefaultProvider"
      android:authorities="com.fsryan.testapp.content"
      android:enabled="true"
      android:exported="false" />
</application
```
- Create the App class that you declared above
```java
public class App extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        // creates the tables based upon your FSGetApi extensions
        // pass your custom authority in to TableGenerator.generate() if you don't want the default
        // if your app has a debug mode, you can call FSDBHelper.initDebug() method instead to get queries spit out to the log
        if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
            FSDBHelper.initDebug(this, "testapp.db", TableGenerator.generate("com.fsryan.testapp.content"));
        } else {
            FSDBHelper.init(this, "testapp.db", TableGenerator.generate("com.fsryan.testapp.content"));
        }
        // the String is your Content Provider's authority
        ForSureAndroidInfoFactory.init(this, "com.fsryan.testapp.content");
        // ForSureAndroidInfoFactory tells ForSure everything it needs to know.
        ForSure.init(ForSureAndroidInfoFactory.inst());
    }
}
```
- Define an interface that extends FSGetApi
```java
@FSTable("user")
public interface UserTable extends FSGetApi {   // <-- you must extend FSGetApi when @FSTable annotates an interface or your app won't compile
    @FSColumn("global_id") long globalId(Retriever retriever);
    @FSColumn("login_count") int loginCount(Retriever retriever);
    @FSColumn("app_rating") double appRating(Retriever retriever);
    @FSColumn("competitor_app_rating") BigDecimal competitorAppRating(Retriever retriever);
}
```
- Migrate the database by using the dbmigrate gradle task (defined by forsuredbplugin)
```
./gradlew dbmigrate
```

## Using the Doc Store feature
Introduced in forsuredbapi-0.8.0, the doc store feature allows for a doc store interface regardless of whether it is backed by a real doc store implementation or by some relational database (as in the current sqlite version). Here are the main differences:
- Your ```@FSTable``` annotated interface must extend ```FSDocStoreGetApi``` instead of ```FSGetApi```.
- This interface must be parameterized with the most basic class (could be ```Object```) that will be stored in this table.
- This interface must have a ```public Class BASE_CLASS``` field that is the ```Class``` object of the most basic class that will be stored in this table.
- Any additional columns that you add must be fields of the base class (just the base class for now). These columns will be indices for fast lookup of records as well as fast retrieval of important data.
- Starting with forsuredbapi-0.8.1, you can provide custom JSON serialization/deserialization for persisting/retrieving objects as JSON documents via Gson. Use forsuredbplugin 0.3.1 and provide the ```resourcesDirectory``` and ```fsJsonAdapterFactoryClass``` properties to the ```forsuredb``` gradle extension. Note that the value of ```fsJsonAdapterFactoryClass``` must be the fully-qualified class name of an implementation of ```FSJsonAdapterFactory```.
- Starting with forsuredbapi-0.8.2 and forsuredbcompiler-0.8.1, you can provide custom ```String``` or ```byte[]``` serialization/deserialization for persisting/retrieving objects via any serializer you want. Use forsuredbplugin 0.3.2 and provide the ```resourcesDirectory``` and ```fsSerializerFactoryClass``` properties to the ```forsuredb``` gradle extension. Note that the value of ```fsSerializerFactoryClass``` must be the fully-qualified class name of an implementation of ```FSSerializerFactory```.
  - Additionally, to implementations of ```FSSerializer``` have been written for you.
    1. ```FSGsonSerializer```, which may be initialized with a custom ```Gson``` object for custom JSON serialization
    2. ```FSSerializableSerializer```, which uses Java's typical object serialization via ```ObjectOutputStream``` and ```ObjectInputStream```.

## Supported Migrations
- Add a table
- Add a column to a table
- Add an index to a table (single-column only)
- Add a unique index column to a table
- Make an existing column a unique index
- Add a foreign key column to a table

## Coming up
- support for inverse migrations of each of the currently supported migrations in 0.12.0? This is going to be a big change because it will mean no need to delete or manually edit migration json files.
- More Doc store support such as adding a migration for when you refactor class names of objects that you may store in the doc store (0.12.0?)
- More querying API improvement?
- An Android Studio/Intellij plugin. Not sure when I'll be able to get to this, though, and it will almost assuredly be part of a separate repo.
- A library for making use of the ```FSSerializer``` plugin which allows for encryption/decryption of stored documents. I'm not sure exactly when I'll be able to get to this, but it will allow you to partially encrypt your database as opposed to using a tool like SQL Cipher.

## Revisions

### 0.11.0
- Removed dependency on Guava
- Added composite key support. Now you can create composite primary and foreign keys.

### forsuredbapi-0.10.1
- Fix issue wherein you had to join to another table in order to do a DISTINCT projection.

### 0.10.0
- You can now narrow down the columns returned by any query by calling the ```Finder``` methods ```columns(String...)``` or ```distinct(String...)```. Calling ```distinct(String...)``` will query for distinct values. Note that if you call either of these methods, then your table API will contain methods that are invalid for the ```Retriever``` that gets returned when you call the ```Resolver.get()``` method.

### 0.9.5
- varargs argument when you want to query for different exact values of the same column. Previously, you had to store an intermediate reference to a Finder class, which, based upon the way resolvers nest, could be really difficult to find the correct type to reference.
- You can now pass multiple values to exact match methods in the case where you want to create something like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1._id = table2.table1_id WHERE (table1.column = 1 OR table1.column = 10 OR table1.column = 100) AND (table2.column = 2 OR table2.column = 20 OR table2.column = 200);
```

### 0.9.4
- more efficient Resolver class generation
- breaks API for your platform's use because the FSJoin class has changed.

### 0.9.3
- More robust querying API for finding/ordering by columns of joined tables.
- Generated Resolver classes are now abstract and have their own ```Base``` class declaration.

### 0.9.2
- You can call ```find()```/```orderBy()``` methods on resolvers for joined tables.
- There is no more ```RelationalResolver``` class--it was unnecessary.
- Order sometimes matters when performing a query

### 0.9.1
- You can call the join methods and ```find()```/```orderBy()``` methods to switch contexts in any order.

### 0.9.0
- Full separation from any DBMS by means of a DBMSIntegrator plugin. Use forsuredbplugin-0.4.0 in order to supply the correct class to the compiler via the forsuredb.dbmsIntegratorClass property in your build.gradle file.
- There was a pretty big problem when switching contexts between adding clauses to your query in the generated querying API. The ```andFinally()``` method is kind of misleading because it could appear several times. This has been changed to ```then()``` in an attempt to make things less confusing. If you're upgrading, you'll have to change all ```andFinally()``` methods to ```then()```

### forsuredbapi-0.8.2 and forsuredbcompiler-0.8.1
- Support for any kind of serialization you want (either to ```String``` or ```byte[]```), using whatever library you want or your own idea of what serialization should be.
- In order to take advantage of this, you should use forsuredbplugin 0.3.2 or greater

### forsuredbapi-0.8.1
- Support for custom ```Gson``` objects by means of a plugin defined by the ```FSJsonAdapterFactory``` interface. You must use forsuredbplugin 0.3.1 or greater and add the ```resourcesDirectory``` and ```fsSerializerFactoryClass``` properties to the ```forsuredb``` gradle extension (or really know what you're doing writing Java plugins).

### 0.8.0  (compiler and api)
- Added doc store feature that stores objects as JSON using ```Gson```. Instead of extending ```FSGetApi``` to define your table's schema, extend ```FSDocStoreGetApi``` and give it a parameter that is the most basic possible object that will get stored in this table. Additionaly, define a ```Class``` field called ```BASE_CLASS``` with the class that you used to parameterize the ```FSDocStoreGetApi``` extension.

### 0.7.1 (compiler and api)
- ```FSColumn``` annotation now has searchable and orderable properties in order to tell the compiler whether to generate the order-by and finder methods for a column in the fluent querying api. Setting these properties to ```false``` will cause the compiler to not generate the order by and finder methods associated with the column.

### 0.7.0 (compiler and api)
- Split into two modules: compiler and api
- No functional changes, but a lot of the cruft that was getting compiled into projects will now be removed

### 0.6.4
- No longer compile lombok into the compiler in order to avoid pulling in a bunch of stuff that is not needed
