 * <p>
 *     Why would you want to use this sort of table?
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>
 *             You wish to persist objects with resistance to addition/subtraction of fields and
 *             openness to change and extension across versions of your software.
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             You wish to persist/replay streams of related events. In this case, the type parameter
 *             would be some generic base class from which potentially many extensions could be used
 *             to describe different types of events.
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
 * </p>
 * @param <T> the base type from which all records will extend. If this type is {@link Object}, then
 *           you will lose basic type-safety guarantees, but it's not the end of the world, as the
 *           somewhat flimsy {@link #className(Retriever)} method will be able to track the java
 *           class of the object. The downfall of this approach is that it is brittle across class
 *           name refactoring.
