/**
 * <p>
 *     Resolver is the entry point for all querying of a specific table.
 *     Typical usage is to call {@link #find()}, followed by chained method
 *     calls that narrow down the records that will be affected/returned by the
 *     query. Retrieval queries are terminated by one of the following calls:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>
 *             {@link #get()}
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             {@link #preserveQueryStateAndGet()}
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     Delete/Create/Update queries have the preceding stage of narrowing down
 *     the affected records, followed by an additional set of method calls
 *     that determine how to change any affected records. The transition to
 *     this stage is triggered by a the {@link #set()} call.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     An extension of Resolver will be automatically generated for you at
 *     compile time for each of your extensions of {@link FSGetApi} that are
 *     annotated with the {@link com.fsryan.forsuredb.annotations.FSTable} annotation.
 *     If the table you defined has {@link com.fsryan.forsuredb.annotations.ForeignKey}
 *     annotated methods, then additional public methods will be created that
 *     allow you to create a query that joins to a foreign table. Access to
 *     instances of this resolver is made available through the generated
 *     ForSure class that will be specific to each project.
 * </p>

 *           You set the "resultParameter" property of the fsryan
 *           gradle extension with the fully-qualified class name of this
