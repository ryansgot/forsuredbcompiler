        <!--
           - when inserting static data for doc store tables, you should either specify the doc column with the
           - string serialization or the blob_doc column with the hexadecimal string representing the bytes of
           - your object. Additionally, it's important to specify the fully-qualified class name of the object
           - serialized in the doc or blob_doc columns.
           -
           - all_types_id is a foreign key reference to all_types._id, it's best to ensure that, at this
           - db_version, there is static data and that the id exists. How do you know the value of the _id?
           - Static data is organized in <records> aggregate tags and <record> detail tags. The <records>
           - aggregates are sorted by way of their db_version attribute, and then each <record> detail is
           - inserted sequentially. Therefore, you can figure out the _id by organizing the <records>
           - aggregates in order of their db_version attribute and counting the records.
